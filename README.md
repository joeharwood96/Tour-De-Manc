# Tour-De-Manc
A web application for a real-world client that allowed 
photographers to upload images of riders in a cycling race 
and using the Google Vision API stored the race number on 
the riderâ€™s bib. Riders could then search a gallery for 
their race day images. (PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL)
